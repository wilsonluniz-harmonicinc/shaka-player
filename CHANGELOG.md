    CueRegion class.  Any application-specific text-parsing plugins that produce
    region information MUST be updated.
  - TextDisplayer plugins that handle region information must do so with the new
    CueRegion interface.  Any application-specific TextDisplayer plugins that
    handle region information MUST be updated.

    use certain PresentationTimeline methods MUST be updated:
    - `setAvailabilityStart()` was renamed to `setUserSeekStart()`.

    persistent licenses).
    - https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player/issues/23

Deprecated:
  - The following methods on Player are deprecated.  They will be removed in
    v1.4.0:
    - getCurrentResolution() (replace with video.videoWidth & video.videoHeight)
    - getCurrentTime()/seek() (replace with video.currentTime)
    - getDuration() (replace with video.duration)
    - getMuted()/setMuted() (replace with video.muted)
    - getVolume()/setVolume() (replace with video.volume)
    - play() (replace with video.play)
    - pause() (replace with video.pause)

Broken compatibility:
  - The license postprocessor callback is no longer given a Restrictions
    argument.  See Player.getRestrictions()/setRestrictions().
